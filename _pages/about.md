I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) advised by <a href='https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/'>Sebastian Scherer</a>. Research interests lie in classical and modern deep-learning based computer vision to build <b>generalizable</b> and <b>efficient</b> perception systems and semantic scene representations to empower field robots.

Before joining the PhD program, I received my B.S in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.kau.edu.sa/">KAU</a> in 2020 ranking 1st amongst my engineering chort securing a scholarship to pursue graduate studies. I then worked as a research software engineer at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">KAUST</a> accelerating distributed deep learning under <a href="https://mcanini.github.io/">Marco Canini</a>. Afterwards, I joined CMU ECE for my M.S in 2022 where I worked in the <a href="https://www.cmu-biometrics.org/">Artificial Intelligence for Vision and Biometrics Center</a> under <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html">Marios Savvides</a> on self-checkout systems, produce reconstruction, product ReID, detection, and synthetic data generation.
